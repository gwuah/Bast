How Can I Contribute?
------------------------
You can contribute to the project through the following ways

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When reporting bugs, there  are a few steps to take
    - Make sure someone else has not made an issue with the same bug. If someone else has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the issue stating your own issues with the relevant traceback errors
    - If the issue has not been reported, create an issue on Github and make sure you follow our ISSUE TEMPLATE as it would make life easier for both you, the maintainers and the community at large
    - Please, use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem
    - Describe the exact steps to take to reproduce the exact same problem both the **how** and **why** in as many details as possible.
    - Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why after following the steps
    - Include the traceback error as a **code snippet** or as an included **screenshot** in order to better trace the errors
    - Include the code block which throws the error as a **code snippet**
    - Include details about your configuration environment (what OS, what python version e.t.c)
